# 📖Uncopylocked Roblox Games Library📖
A massive and costantly updating archive of games spanning the entire history of roblox, from **`2006`** to **`2025`**.

## Purpose 🤔
Roblox only exists thanks to the community and their games. A lot of games have become lost media and many others are at risk of disappearing forever. This archive aims to preserve as many games as possible.

## Status of the games 🟩🟥
Most of the games prior to mid 2018, which is when Filtering Enabled was forced as the default, are broken and i don't have neither the time nor the skills to go through every single place and update them, though it's possible for anyone else to do so if they please.

## Risks ⚠
Around 80% of the games in this list are the raw files that come from the uncopylocked places on Roblox, however i got the remaining 20% on old dumps found in various forums, I've checked **`every`** single game and didn't notice, or removed, malicious or mysterious code (Infected scripts don't count because they're basically part of those games at this point). In short, there's no problem to run those games locally in Studio, but if you want to publish them, it's always good practice to make sure you understand what the code does.

## Unknown games ❓
Sometimes i happen to stumble upon a game file and not be able to identify the original creator and/or the original place. In that case I've put them in a folder called `Unknown` in hope that someone more knowledgeable than me can let me know the original owner and possibly a link to the original place on Roblox.

## How the files are organized 📖
The games are divided by year and organized by user. There's a folder for every year and every file name starts with the game owner's name first and is followed by the game name, while unknown games are organized by: year range - possible owner(s) - game name/original file name.
